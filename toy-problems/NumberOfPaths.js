The problem is to count all the possible paths from top left to bottom right of a MxN matrix with the constraints that from each cell you can either move to right or down.

Example 1:

Input:
M = 3 and N = 3
Output: 6
Explanation:
Let the given input 3*3 matrix is filled
as such:
A B C
D E F
G H I
The possible paths which exists to reach
'I' from 'A' following above conditions
are as follows:ABCFI, ABEHI, ADGHI, ADEFI,
ADEHI, ABEFI


Example 2:

Input:
M = 2 and N = 8
Output: 8
